Todo Task Application was developed using Angular. Key features include:

Separate Service Injections: Utilizes Angular services to manage data logic and state, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

Tooltip Directives: Implements custom directives, ToolTipDirective and ToolTipSingletonDirective, to enhance user interface interactivity.

Modular Component Structure: Consists of well-defined components such as todo-item, todos, and edit-todo-dialog, each with distinct responsibilities, promoting reusability and ease of testing.

LocalStorage Integration: Incorporates localStorage for persistent storage of todos, ensuring user data is saved across sessions.

Bulma CSS Framework: Leverages the Bulma framework for styling, providing a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.

This Todo Task Application is not just a practical tool for managing daily tasks but also serves as an exemplar of effective Angular application architecture.
